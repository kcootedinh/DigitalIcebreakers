# Digital Icebreakers

Digital Icebreakers is a platform for presenters and audiences to collaborate, play, and experiment together.

## How it works
A presenter creates a *Lobby* and audience members join by pointing their phone cameras at the presenter's screen and scanning the QR code. The presenter can then guide the audience through games and experiences by clicking *New Game*.  Try it out on [digitalicebreakers.com](https://digitalicebreakers.com).
